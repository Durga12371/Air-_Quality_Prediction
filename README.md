# Air-_Quality_Prediction

--> Air pollution is caused by the presence of poison gases and substances: it is impacted by the metrological factors of a particular place, such as temperature ,relative humidity, precipitation ,wind speed ,wind direction, which was collected by sensors.
 --> Dataset : 
we collect the Dataset from Kaggle and it is Structured data in CSV format The dataset plays a major role in accurate prediction also as the right features make the prediction more realistic and with least variance.
--> Models trained on : Random Forest Regression
--> Random Forest Regression:
         Random forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm.It is perhaps the most popular and widely used machine learning algorithm given its good or excellent performance across awide range of 5 classification and regression predictive modeling problems. again using grid searchcv to get best parameters and fitting best parameters to it and it got very good accuracy 97.26. By above three models Random forest classification is getting good accuracy compared to other model.
--> The aim of the Project is to predict the AQI and Random forest regession produce better prediction than linear regression algorithms.
-->Ealier techniques such as probability stastics etc.. were used to predict the quality of air but those methods are complex topredict.Present,there are  also linear regression used to predict the air quality regreesion but it give less accurary.Thatâ€™s why we are using random forest regreesion.It is  the best algorithm suited well for  this prediction of air pollution  as it provides great predicting an accuracy
